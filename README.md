# Shellscripts
I store my UNIX Bash shell scripts here. These scripts are mainly compatible with all versions of Mac OSX and any Linux distro, but some features require things such as the APT packaging system and/or external applications (Git, Perl) to be installed and ready to use.

- Perl (for minification support, comes with every BSD (OS X e.g.)/Linux distro by default)
